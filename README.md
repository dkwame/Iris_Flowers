Iris Flowers Classification Problem

The objective of this project is to briefly train and compare and rank models that can accurately identify a particular type of flower (Iris-Setosa, Iris-Virginica, Iris-Versicolor) by their characteristics. The models trained will be Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNeighbors, SVM, and Random Forest Classifier.

The Iris Flowers dataset is a multi-class classification problem with 150 instances such that each class holds 50 instances each.

We have a three way tie for first with Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression sharing the first place pedestal with an average accuracy of 93%.
 Further work will include advantages and disadvantages of each model selected as well as parameter exploration. 

Additionally, feature engineering for variable transformation as well as variable removal in order to improve accuracies will be considered.
